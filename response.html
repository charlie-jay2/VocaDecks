        Collaboration Proposal - VocaDecks X CaseOh
      </h2>

      <p>Hi there!</p>

      <p>
        Thanks for getting back to me. VocaDecks is a fan project that turns the
        virtual synthesizers known as Vocaloids into Digital playing cards. At
        the minute, our website is still under development but very close to
        being finished. On the website, users will be able to use the cards they
        collect and battle with other people to win cards and levels. Something
        similar to the UNO PC game would be comparable. (I have attached a
        potential mockup image of our game design plan).
      </p>

      <p>
        I had in mind for this to be an organic Collab and CaseOh would try out
        the game on stream, and we would give him access to his card from the
        start. Case would be the first of our Creators Program we plan to
        release.
      </p>

      <p>
        As I said, the website is still in development but very close to being
        finished, so I'd like to propose a sort of "deadline".
      </p>

      <p>
        Please allow until Mid-End of April for us to put the finishing touches
        on our game, and I can assure you I'll stay in touch along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        It would also be amazing if we could get any criticism or feedback from
        CaseOh or his team on any requirements and/or changes to be made to his
        collaboration with us.
      </p>

      <p>We look forward to working with him.</p>

      <p>Thanks again,</p>

      <p>-Will</p>
