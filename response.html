        Collaboration Proposal - VocaDecks X CaseOh
      </h2>

      <p>Hi there!</p>

      <p>
        Thanks for getting back to me. <strong>VocaDecks</strong> is a fan
        project that turns the virtual synthesizers known as
        <strong>Vocaloids</strong> into digital playing cards. At the moment,
        our website is still under development but is very close to being
        finished. On the website, users will be able to collect cards and battle
        against other players to win cards and level upâ€”comparable to the
        <em>UNO</em> PC game.
      </p>

      <p>
        I envisioned this as an organic collaboration where
        <strong>CaseOh</strong> could try out the game on stream, and we would
        give him access to his card from the start. Case would be the first
        member of our upcoming <strong>Creators Program</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        As mentioned, our website is still in development but nearing
        completion. I'd like to propose a deadline of
        <strong>mid-to-end of April</strong> for the final touches, and I assure
        you that I will stay in touch along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        It would be amazing to receive any feedback from CaseOh or his team
        regarding any requirements or adjustments that would improve his
        collaboration experience with us.
      </p>

      <p>We look forward to working with him.</p>

      <p>Thanks again,</p>

      <p>
        <strong>Will</strong><br />
